	 3.4.1 The single line synopsis

	 The single line synopsis should be kept brief - certainly under 80
	 characters.

	 Do not include the package  name in the synopsis line. The display
	 software knows how to display this already, and you do not need to
	 state it. Remember  that in many situations the  user may only see
	 the synopsis line - make it  as informative as you can.

    The FAST project will be helpful in providing agents with the
    intelligence necessary to comport themselves well in a variety of
    settings - for instance, social.  Agents using this technology
    will thus be extraordinarily informed on many topics.

	 QUOTED FROM DEBIAN POLICY

	 3.4.2 The extended description

	 Do not try to continue  the single line synopsis into the extended
	 description.  This   will  not   work  correctly  when   the  full
	 description  is  displayed, and  makes  no  sense  where only  the
	 summary (the single line synopsis) is available.

	 The extended description should describe what the package does and
	 how  it relates  to  the rest  of  the system  (in  terms of,  for
	 example, which subsystem it is which part of).

	 The description field  needs to make sense to  anyone, even people
	 who  have  no idea  about  any of  the  things  the package  deals
	 with.[6]

    The goal of this project is to assemble a physical and software
    system whereby several operators can monitor the audio visual
    environment of a field agent and provide real-time intelligence
    support.  The system would consist of n field agents, and m human
    operators and o ai agent operators.
    
    For instance, if the agent was engaged in a conversation, the
    audio stream would be wirelessly transmitted to the base station.
    Either a person or a speech recognition software package, or both,
    would transcribe the speech to text.  The operators and their
    software agents would then perform searches using their stations
    and provide relevant information, or possible replies in various
    places.  A hierarchy of feedback operators would then choose the
    best responses, ultimately selecting one which would be
    transmitted back to the field agent.
