(fast needs to have a simulation mode where it plays the role of
 the other person using an LLM and says their bit out loud...,
 which is recorded by the LLM and does so)

(I just thought of a really good system. Take a wireless
 headset. Feed the audio through to
 whisper-ctranslate2/diarization. Have the LLM generate best
 counterarguments to invalid arguments that others say, and play
 back through the headset.)
